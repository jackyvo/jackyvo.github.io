I am a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer with extensive experience with more than 8 years of working experience in a wide variety of business areas, including healthcare, real estate, cloud automation, and more.

I write clean, modular, well-documented code with security and scalability in mind and help create simple, friendly, accessible user interfaces.

My main passion is to build clean robust software that solves the problem of users.

I have a good skill in API design, complex client/server interaction, and a well-tested codebase. I also have experience in UX, product, and project management and I know how to be a part of a good team and how to be a leader one as well.
